        <h2 class="subheader">About Me</h2>
        
        <p>Hafa adai, my name is Jason Arjona. I was born and raised on a little island called Guam. In Guam, hafa adai means hello in the Chamorro language. I recently moved to the mainland in 2021 and currently reside in Seattle. I moved here to try and break into the tech industry so now I am a student in the Year Up program for quality assurance. I eventually want to work my way up to become a game developer. There are multiple video game companies that I would love to work for but Bethesda would be my number one choice. I really enjoyed playing their video games growing up. I invested so much time into their games Skyrim and Fallout. Aside from wanting to be a video game developer, a goal of mine is to be able to create a software that lets blind people play any type of video game through haptic feedback. </p>

        <h2 class="subheader">Hobbies</h2>

        <p>I really enjoy playing video games, watching anime, going to the gym, listening to music and going for walks to watch the sunset. As far as I can remember, I have been playing video games my whole life. Now, I always play games with my friends from back home in Guam. We usually play either Apex Legends, Rocket League, Fortnite or Elden Ring. Anime is another hobby of mine. I grew up watching Dragon Ball Z so I think that is what started my interest in anime. My top two favorite anime are Hunter x Hunter and Naruto. I have four tattoos inspired from Hunter x Hunter. Going to gym has helped me with my self-confidence a lot since I started going. Now I've grown to love working out and trying to better myself. Whenever I can, I go on a walk to watch the sunset to help clear my mind. It also just looks so beautiful. </p>
